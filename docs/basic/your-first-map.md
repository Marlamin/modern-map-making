# Your first map
Now that setup is done, it's time to start editing!

## Loading in
- Open Noggit.
- Select the map name you set in the previous tutorial (e.g. `My New Map`).
- Double click somewhere on the grid map.
- Upon first open it will prompt you for a Max UID check, just hit "Get Max UID".

## Welcome to your new home
Now that you are finally inside Noggit's world editor, make sure to look around and explore the UI for a bit first.  
Also check out Help -> Key Bindings for basic key binding information.

*This is where the tutorial ends for now, but we're working on adding more very soon.*
