# Common Issues
- When editing continents you might encounter terrain un-loading after making sizable height changes, to mitigate that add [this occluder file](pathname:///resources/yourmapname_occ.wdt) to the patch. If you are editing existing maps like Eastern Kingdoms rename and place it in `world/maps/azeroth/azeroth_occ.wdt` where Azeroth is the directory/internal name of your map.
